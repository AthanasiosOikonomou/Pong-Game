# Pong-Game

I created this game as side project to learn how to use gui on python.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Consouldenature/Pong-Game`
2. Run the game: `Pong.exe`
3. In the folder 'Pong Game Codes' you can find all the python codes for this game.

i. main.py is the main code file used for the game.
ii. ball.py is the ball.
iii. paddle.py is for the paddles.
iv. scoreboard.py is for keeping the score.

## How to Play

- 1st player (Left side) needs to use the key 'w' to move upwards
  and the key 's' to move downwards.
- 2nd player (right side) needs to use the 'Up arrow' to move upwards
  and the 'Down arrow' to move downwards.
  
## Notes

- The game will stop when one player score 5 points.
- Everytime the ball hits a paddle the ball speeds up.

## Future Development

- I want to add a 're-play' option
- Fix the paddles to not move throught walls
- Fix the paddles to move while holding down the keys
